For its verification, a layered testbench provides a systematic approach by separating stimulus 
generation, transaction handling, and checking into distinct layers. This methodology enhances 
reusability and scalability while enabling focused testing of individual components and their 
interactions. 
The verification process for a Fibonacci module using a layered testbench typically involves: 
a) Stimulus Layer: Random or directed generation of input indices (e.g., n) for which 
Fibonacci numbers need to be calculated. 
b) Driver Layer: Translating transactions into low-level signals for the Design Under 
Test (DUT). 
c) Monitor Layer: Observing output responses and correlating them with expected 
Fibonacci values. 
d) Scoreboard and Coverage: Tracking functional coverage to ensure all scenarios, such 
as boundary conditions and recursive calculations, are tested adequately. 
By integrating these layers, the verification process ensures robustness and correctness in the 
Fibonacci computation logic while maintaining a structured and reusable approach.
